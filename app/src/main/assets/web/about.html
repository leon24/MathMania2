                <p>We are four students currently enrolled at Newton, a school for higher vocational education and training, studying to become application developers for mobile devices. This game is the result of a project we conducted halfway through the curriculum, aiming to showcase what we've learned so far.</p>

                <p>The game concept is, plain and simple, to get better at multiplication by repeatedly challenging yourself to get a better score than last time. There is two different difficulties to choose from, which affects how many answers are presented during gameplay, but also how much time you have at your disposal.</p>

                <p>We, as a group, felt like we wanted to give something back to the world. Multiplication is something a lot of people of both different ages and backgrounds struggle with on a daily basis. In an effort to solve this problem, we set out to try and combine a funny and challenging gameplay with a learning element.</p>
                <p>Hopefully you'll find that we succeded with our goal - all and any input is much appreciated at <a href="mailto:someone@example.com?Subject=Hello%20again" target="_top">input@mathmania.com!</a></p>
